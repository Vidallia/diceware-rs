KISS & YAGNI
Bugs:
- ** Write unit tests.
- * pub fn get_word_count - Refactor
- ** Figure out how to only need to creat a FileOut instance if the user use's the Flag **
- ** Entering a non-existent path causes program to panic **

Needs Implementing:
- Allow for choice in amount of words generated
    - Display warning if less than 3
- Setup CLI
    - ** Finish the file flag ** 
    - Allow for passphrase generated to have random symbols instead of whitespace between words
    - Allow for numbers to be added to password sequence as well
    - Allow for user to have their own diceware word list
    - Use more subcommands like: 
    SUBCOMMANDS:
    add          Add a new generator
    dash         Show realtime dashboard with all generators
    delete       Delete generator
    eradicate    Delete all generators
    help         Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    list         List all generators
    rename       Rename generator

Nice to Have:
- Add border to output similar to how mysql's gui does it
- Generate passwords to file of a given name
